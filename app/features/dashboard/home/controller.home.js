    Because of how we defined Gulp inject JS files, all modules.*.js files were injected in the very top of the app.js
    in assets/js/app.js file. This allows us to append controllers, services/factories or directives to an existing
    module.

    That why we don't use the empty array in the module declaration. In this case we say that we are going to append
    a controller called HomeController to the dashboard module.

    Using PascalCase we define the name of the controller and the function associate as well.

    As a second param out function is getting 'userInfo' which is defined in the resolve from dashboard state in the
    module.dashboard.js
