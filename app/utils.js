/*
 Sometimes we need to have a temporal variable accessible across the entire application but we don't mind if we loose it
 by reloading the web. For example, if we have a list with content paginated and we want to edit some articles but
 without loosing the page we were at the list, we can save it as a temporal variable and then recover it.
 To do that we should use $rootScope but injecting it in every controller/service/factory we want to recover or save it.
 This is an alike function that uses $rootScope but makes it accessible by $scope so we don't have to inject it every
 time.

 We have three small functions. Create, remove and get. How to use it?
 1- Creating a temporal variable: $scope.tmpData('add', 'variableName', 'content');
 1- Removing a temporal variable: $scope.tmpData('remove', 'variableName');
 1- Getting  a temporal variable: $scope.tmpData('get', 'variableName');

 We can storage an object, array or simply a string.
